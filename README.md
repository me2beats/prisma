# 3D Low-Poly Editor

This is a project to create a 3D editor for low-poly 3D modeling that runs in the browser using HTML5.

The project is currently in the prototype stage and uses the babylon.js library for 3D rendering.

The goal is to create a simple and intuitive editor that can be used on both desktop and mobile devices.
